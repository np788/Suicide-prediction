# Suicide-prediction

This work was performed in collaboration with a group at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. I applied machine learning algorithms to a dataset of questionnaire responses from psychiatric patients. The questionnaire was designed to assess suicide risk without directly mentioning "suicide" anywhere. The team had already attained some promising results using a basic logistic regression model. I proposed to use different algorithms, sampling techniques, and performance metrics.
